# Web extension: TabSaver
I often end up with a window (or many windows) full of tabs with articles or videos about some subject I want to study.
Usually I just save a session, but then I forget about it and lose reference to all those videos and articles. 
That's why I created this extension: As a way to save all those tabs in a text file so I can go back to them later.

Unless you click on it, this extension won't do anything, and it does not collect any data whatsoever. This is free and 
open source software, so feel free to check the code and make sure it's safe.

# Permissions
These permissions in the context of a browser extension have the following meanings:

1. `"tabs"`: This permission allows the extension to interact with the browser's tab system. This includes getting 
information about open tabs, opening new ones, closing existing ones, and even updating properties of a tab such as 
its URL.

2. `"downloads"`: This permission allows the extension to interact with the browser's download system. It can be used 
to programmatically initiate, manage, search and monitor downloads.
